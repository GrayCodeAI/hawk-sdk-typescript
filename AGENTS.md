# hawk-sdk-typescript Conventions

Official TypeScript client for the Hawk daemon API.

## Development workflow

When starting any new work (feature, fix, refactor, chore), always create a feature branch from `main` first. Never commit directly to `main`. Use branch naming conventions like `feat/<description>`, `fix/<description>`, or `chore/<description>`. Open a PR, ensure CI is green, then merge.

## Build & Test

```bash
npm install       # install dev dependencies (typescript, tsx, node:test)
npm run build     # compile to dist/
npm run typecheck # type-check without emitting
npm test          # run the test suite (node:test via tsx)
npm run lint      # run linter
```

The runtime build in `dist/` has **zero dependencies** — it relies only on the
global `fetch`, `ReadableStream`, and `TextDecoder` available in Node 18+.

## Design Principles

- Dependency-free: zero third-party runtime imports
- Type safety: full TypeScript type annotations
- Dual client: `HawkClient` with sync and streaming variants
- Local-only: designed for developers running Hawk locally

## Ecosystem Boundaries

- Consumer of Hawk public APIs only
- Do not import from engine repos (`eyrie`, `yaad`, `tok`, `trace`, `sight`, `inspect`)

## GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **hawk-sdk-typescript** (300 symbols, 800 relationships, 25 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> Index stale? Run `node .gitnexus/run.cjs analyze` from the project root — it auto-selects an available runner. No `.gitnexus/run.cjs` yet? `npx gitnexus analyze` (npm 11 crash → `npm i -g gitnexus`; #1939).

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows. For regression review, compare against the default branch: `detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})`.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `query({search_query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `context({name: "symbolName"})`.
- For security review, `explain({target: "fileOrSymbol"})` lists taint findings (source→sink flows; needs `analyze --pdg`).

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `detect_changes()` to check affected scope.
